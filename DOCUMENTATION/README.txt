This 2D side-scroller level was created by myself and 3 other individuals for a Java class
in college.

This game level was created using pure Java and was developed in the Intellij IDEA IDE.


GOAL
-------------------------------

1. Progress through the level and defeat as many spiders as you can!
2. Defeat the boss at the end of the level.
3. You Win!


Controls 
--------------------------------
* 'WASD' keys to move.
* 'I' key to shoot projectiles.
* 'O' key to perform a normal attack.
* 'P' key to glide. This only works if you are in the air, so be sure to jump first! :)

Projectiles
---------------------------------
Shooting a projectile requires 2 "star power". You start off with 4 star power,
and you earn 1 extra star power from each spider you defeat. 

Health
---------------------------------
You start off with 5 health. Every time you take damage, you lose 1 health.'
There is no way to earn back health, so try not to take too much damage before the boss fight.

The Boss
---------------------------------
The boss is located at the end of the level. Normal attacks do NOT work on him, 
so you'll have to shoot projectiles. 

The boss must take damage from 12 projectiles before he is defeated. 
So you need to land a hit on him 12 times!

SKIPPING THE LEVEL
---------------------------------
Pressing the '.' button will automatically send you to the end of the level
with full Star Power. So, if you just want to fight the boss, press the '.' button
on your keyboard.
